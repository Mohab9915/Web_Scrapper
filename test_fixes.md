# Testing the Fixes for ScrapeMaster AI

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Scraped Data Fields
**Problem**: Only "area" field was displayed, "name" field was missing
**Fix**: Modified data filtering logic in Dashboard.js to include ALL selected fields

### 2. RAG Functionality Not Working
**Problem**: RAG switch was not working reliably
**Fix**: Replaced with a button that only appears after scraping completion

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Data Display Fix
1. Create a new project named "test1"
2. Add a countries website URL with fields "name, area"
3. Run scraping
4. Verify BOTH "name" and "area" fields are displayed in results
5. Check all display formats (Table, Paragraph, Raw)

### Test 2: RAG Button Functionality
1. After scraping is complete, verify RAG button appears
2. Click "Enable RAG" button
3. Verify button changes to "RAG Enabled" state
4. Verify chat functionality becomes available
5. Test querying the scraped data via chat

### Expected Results
- All selected fields should be visible in scraping results
- RAG button should only appear after successful scraping
- RAG enabling should work reliably
- Chat should work with RAG-enabled projects

## Files Modified
- `new-front/src/Dashboard.js`: Fixed data filtering and added RAG button handler
- `new-front/src/URLsManagement.js`: Removed RAG switch, added RAG button

## Backend Integration
- Uses existing `/api/v1/projects/{id}/enable-rag` endpoint
- Updates project RAG status via `/api/v1/projects/{id}` PUT endpoint
- Maintains compatibility with existing RAG system
